Description: A set of tools for determining the necessary sample size
    in order to identify the optimal dynamic treatment regime
    in a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART). 
    Utilizes multiple comparisons with the best methodology 
    to adjust for multiple comparisons.
    Designed for an arbitrary SMART design. Please see Artman (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy064> for more details.
